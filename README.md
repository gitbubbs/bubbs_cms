# Welcome!

## So what are we building?

*Well, i guess there are millions of these solutions out there but what im aiming for is some kind of superlightweight WP admin with zero to minimum CSS.*

*I'm building this mainly for myself to have a more lightweight, less bloated, flexible and scalable alternative to WP.*

*If i can get pointers, ideas, code or whatever from more experienced Laravel devs it would be much appreciated.*

*The goal is to make it equally easy and enjoyable for the developer as for the customer.*

*This will include a preconnected React frontend for the admin but this should be easy to remove and there will be a guide to work with the admin with any framework preferred*

## This will include:
### -Posts
### -Categories
### -Tags
### -Pages
### -Media gallery
### -Themes file (Fonts, Colors etc...)
### -Basic setup for email service
*...this is going to be updated along the way*
